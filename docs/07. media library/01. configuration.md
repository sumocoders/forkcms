# Configuration

The media library uses the [Liip Imagine Bundle](http://symfony.com/doc/1.0/bundles/LiipImagineBundle/index.html) to serve the images.

The media library in fork comes with 5 predefined filters. For more information about how to configure filters you can check the [official Liip Imagine Bundle documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/1.0/bundles/LiipImagineBundle/filters.html).

The 5 predefined filters can be found in `app/config.yml`.

If you want to add your own filters you can append them to the config.
